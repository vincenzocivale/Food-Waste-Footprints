# Food Waste Footprints: Uncovering Country-Level Contributions to the Issue

This project aims to uncover the contributions of different countries to the global issue of food waste. The project uses data provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, to analyze and visualize various aspects of food waste.

## Overview

The project focuses on the following key areas:

1. **Global Food Waste**: Analyzing the increase in food waste worldwide over the years and identifying the most wasted food items.

2. **Country-Level Analysis**: Identifying the top and worst countries in terms of food waste. The analysis is based on the measure of Loss Percentage, which indicates the level of waste relative to the amount of available food.

3. **Critical Food Supply Stage**: Determining the most critical phase of the food supply where most waste occurs.

4. **Data Science Solutions**: Proposing data science solutions to combat hunger and food waste. These include predicting supply and demand, increasing citizens' awareness, global collaboration, and field-specific optimization.

## Datasets

The primary dataset used in this project is provided by the FAO and encompasses a broad array of statistics related to agriculture, food, and global food security.

## Tools and Technologies

The project involves the use of various data analysis and visualization tools. The exact tools and technologies used will be updated as the project progresses.
